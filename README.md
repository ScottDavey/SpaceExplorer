# Space Explorer

This is an arcade style game whose objective is to explore the universe. You start as a little spaceship and take off from earth. The more you discover, the more money you'll receive until you can buy upgrades for your spaceship that will allow you to go further.

Here are some general notes about gameplay:

- This will be a top-down style 2D game with parallax effects to show the depth of space.
- Starting sequence is always at earth. The player can rotate the spaceship manually around the circumference of the earth, or punch in coordinates.
    - Coordinates can be saved into your log book when you reach/discover new places.
- There will be random asteroids, rogue planets, asteroid groups wizzing past. Hopefully they don't stop your spaceship
- The spaceship can be destroyed if you run into a planet, or star, or black hole.
- The spaceship can also get stuck in orbit if passing by something large at just the right velocity.
- You CANNOT change the trajectory of the spaceship manually.
- You CAN slingshot off of the gravity from other large celestial bodies.
- This will be a relaxing game with good music. In theory, the player could complete the game with the starting spaceship, however it would take a long time as there will be exciting things to discover really far away.
- The player can abort the current flight and try again.
- There won't be a "game completed" objective. Instead, there will be a hidden list of interesting things to discover.
